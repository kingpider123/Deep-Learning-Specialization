# PARAMETERS: 
W and b -- being controlled by hyperparameters

# HYPERPARAMETERS:
Hyperparameters are the settings you choose before training a machine learning model—they’re not learned from the data, but they control how the learning happens.
* Learning rate $\alpha$
* Number of iterations
* Number of hidden layers $L$
* Number of hidden units per layer
* Choice of activation function
* Momentum
* Mini batch size
* Regularization
